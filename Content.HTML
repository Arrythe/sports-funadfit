We may not always agree with what others think is fun.
 Spinning Hula Hoops might not be your cup of tea, but an Irish dance class tickles your toe.
Skydiving makes your heartbeat just a bit too fast, but a row in the lakes floats your boat.
HOW CAN YOU PUT SOME FUN INTO YOUR FITNESS?
• Plan a short trip to a beautiful place where you'll be motivated to be more active than usual.
• Involve your family and friends in an activity.
• Something new
• Something old-if the last ballet classyou had was in the third grade, it's time to try it again
• Jump rope
• Play with your kids</p>

                        Exercise is any bodily activity that enhances or maintains physical fitness and overall health and wellness.[1]
                        
                        It is performed for various reasons: to aid growth and improve strength, prevent aging, develop muscles and the cardiovascular system, hone athletic skills, weight loss or maintenance, improve health,[2] or simply for enjoyment. Many individuals choose to exercise outdoors where they can congregate in groups, socialize, and improve well-being as well as mental health.[3][4]
                        
                        In terms of health benefits, the amount of recommended exercise depends upon the goal, the type of exercise, and the age of the person. Even doing a small amount of exercise is healthier than doing.</p>

                <h3 style="color: blue;">WHAT IS FITNESS?</h3>
                <p id="para1">
                    Physical fitness is a state of health and well-being and, more specifically, the ability to perform aspects of sports, occupations and daily activities. Physical fitness is generally achieved through proper nutrition,[1] moderate-vigorous physical exercise,[2] and sufficient rest.[3]

Before the Industrial Revolution, fitness was defined as the capacity to carry out the day's activities without undue fatigue or lethargy. However, with automation and changes in lifestyles, physical fitness is now considered a measure of the body's ability to function efficiently and effectively in work and leisure activities, to be healthy, to resist hypokinetic diseases, and to meet emergency situations.[4]
